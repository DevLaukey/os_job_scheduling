## Overview
`os_job_scheduling` is a project aimed at implementing efficient scheduling algorithms used in operating systems to allocate tasks and manage resources. The goal of this project is to provide an educational resource and a practical tool for developers and students to understand and work with different job scheduling strategies.

### Why os_job_scheduling?
Scheduling is a core function of an operating system that involves allocating CPU time to processes and tasks. This project helps to:
- Visualize and simulate scheduling algorithms for educational purposes.
- Provide a framework to understand the intricacies of job scheduling.
- Enhance problem-solving skills by offering hands-on experience with task scheduling techniques.

### Core Features
- ðŸ“… **Task Scheduling Algorithms:** Implementations of multiple job scheduling algorithms such as FCFS (First Come First Serve), SJF (Shortest Job First), and Round Robin.
- ðŸ“Š **Performance Evaluation:** Compare and analyze the efficiency of different scheduling algorithms.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Modular Design:** Easily extendable to include more scheduling techniques.

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

### Installation
Clone the repository and compile the code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devlaukey/os_job_scheduling.git
cd os_job_scheduling
gcc -o scheduler main.c scheduler.c -I.
```

### Usage
Run the compiled scheduler to simulate a scheduling algorithm:
```bash
./scheduler
```
Provide the necessary inputs as prompted to observe scheduling behavior.

### Testing
Execute the test suite to verify functionalities:
```bash
gcc -o test_scheduler test_scheduler.c scheduler.c -I.
./test_scheduler
```
